# Suppression of a summarised_result obejct

## Minimum cell count suppression

Minimum cell count suppression is very important in studies as it is
essential step to ensure no reidentification. The min cell count
suppression can vary source to source, but in general a minimum cell
count of 5 is fixed. In this vignette we explain how the suppression
process works for `summarised_result` objects.

### How suppression works

In general a record is suppressed if 3 conditions are met:

1.  The `estimate_name` field contains the word ‘count’ (e.g ‘count’,
    ‘outcome_count’, ‘count_of_individuals’, …).
2.  The `estimate_type` field is either *numeric* or *integer*.
3.  The `estimate_value` numeric value is smaller than *minCellCount*
    and bigger than 0.

This simple rule determines the suppression at record level. The
suppressed record is not removed from the results, instead the
`estimate_value` field is populated as ‘\<{minCellCount}’.

Once one record is suppressed this can trigger suppression of other
*linked* estimates. This suppression is done at different level and
affects different rows of the result object:

- **Suppression at group level**: if in the suppressed estimate the
  field `variable_name` is populated with the word “number records” or
  “number subjects” (it is not case sensitive) then the whole group of
  records will be suppressed. Note a group of records is a set of rows
  with the same: `result_id`, `cdm_name`, `group_name`, `group_level`,
  `strata_name`, `strata_level`, `additional_name`, `additional_level`.
  This level of suppression is for example to suppress all the
  demographics of a cohort of individuals that has less than the minimum
  amount of records required. For developers note that creating a row
  with `variable_name` = “number records/subjects” can have a big impact
  on the suppression, but at the same point it gives you the ability to
  link a group of estimates and suppress all of them at the same point.

- **Suppression at variable_name level**: if in the suppressed estimate
  the field `estimate_name` is populated with either “count”,
  “denominator_count”, “outcome_count”, “record_count” or
  “subject_count” then the suppression is done at the variable level,
  meaning that all the estimates with the same: `result_id`, `cdm_name`,
  `group_name`, `group_level`, `strata_name`, `strata_level`,
  `additional_name`, `additional_level` and `variable_name` will be
  suppressed. This level of suppression is for example to suppress the
  statistics associated with an outcome count for example, but not do
  not affect the different outcomes for example. For developers use one
  of this key words to link the estimates at the variable level.

- **Suppression of percentages**: if an estimate is suppressed any
  estimate in the same level (same `result_id`, `cdm_name`,
  `group_name`, `group_level`, `strata_name`, `strata_level`,
  `additional_name`, `additional_level`, `variable_name` and
  `variable_level`) with the same estimate name but changing ‘count’ for
  ‘percentage’ (e.g. ‘event_count’ -\> ‘event_percentage’) will be
  suppressed.

Note that linked estimate records will be suppressed as ‘-’.

### Suppressing a summarised_result object

Once we have a summarised result, we can suppress the object based on a
desired minimum cell count value using the
[`suppress()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/omopgenerics/reference/suppress.html)
function.

``` r
library(omopgenerics, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

result <- newSummarisedResult(
  x = tibble(
    result_id = 1L,
    cdm_name = "my_cdm",
    group_name = "cohort_name",
    group_level = "cohort1",
    strata_name = "sex",
    strata_level = "male",
    variable_name = "Age group",
    variable_level = "10 to 50",
    estimate_name = "count",
    estimate_type = "numeric",
    estimate_value = "5",
    additional_name = "overall",
    additional_level = "overall"
  ),
  settings = tibble(
    result_id = 1L,
    package_name = "PatientProfiles",
    package_version = "1.0.0",
    study = "my_characterisation_study",
    result_type = "stratified_by_age_group"
  )
)

suppressedResult <- suppress(result = result, minCellCount = 7)
```

### Is a summarised_result object suppressed?

The minCellCount suppression is recorded in the settings of the object:

``` r
glimpse(settings(result))
#> Rows: 1
#> Columns: 9
#> $ result_id       <int> 1
#> $ result_type     <chr> "stratified_by_age_group"
#> $ package_name    <chr> "PatientProfiles"
#> $ package_version <chr> "1.0.0"
#> $ group           <chr> "cohort_name"
#> $ strata          <chr> "sex"
#> $ additional      <chr> ""
#> $ min_cell_count  <chr> "0"
#> $ study           <chr> "my_characterisation_study"
glimpse(settings(suppressedResult))
#> Rows: 1
#> Columns: 9
#> $ result_id       <int> 1
#> $ result_type     <chr> "stratified_by_age_group"
#> $ package_name    <chr> "PatientProfiles"
#> $ package_version <chr> "1.0.0"
#> $ group           <chr> "cohort_name"
#> $ strata          <chr> "sex"
#> $ additional      <chr> ""
#> $ min_cell_count  <chr> "7"
#> $ study           <chr> "my_characterisation_study"
```

As a result object can be partially suppressed (e.g. binding an object
that has already been suppressed with another one that is not
suppressed) and settings of results objects can be long we also have a
utility function to check if an object has been suppressed or not,
[`isResultSuppressed()`](https://darwin-eu.github.io/omopgenerics/reference/isResultSuppressed.html):

``` r
isResultSuppressed(result = result, minCellCount = 5)
#> Warning: ✖ 1 set (1 row) not suppressed.
#> [1] FALSE
isResultSuppressed(result = suppressedResult, minCellCount = 5)
#> Warning: ! 1 set (1 row) suppressed with minCellCount > 5.
#> [1] FALSE
isResultSuppressed(result = suppressedResult, minCellCount = 7)
#> ✔ The <summarised_result> is suppressed with
#> minCellCount = 7.
#> [1] TRUE
isResultSuppressed(result = suppressedResult, minCellCount = 10)
#> Warning: ✖ 1 set (1 row) suppressed with minCellCount < 10.
#> [1] FALSE
```
